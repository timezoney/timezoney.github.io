To launch the application (second feature):
1. type "node server.js" in the terminal (terminal should be opened in the docs folder);
2. go to "http://localhost:3000/catalog_employees.html" or "http://localhost:3000/catalog_jobs.html" in your browser (the feature includes 2 pages);

Catalog pages load data from posts.json file and create links that redirect users to "view post" page with the id of chosen post.
(Second feature includes files: catalog_employees.html, catalog_jobs.html, catalog.css 
                                and files to process data: server.js, data_utils.js, users.json, posts.json)
(Since we don't have any users to create posts, we had to use post placeholders for demonstration)
