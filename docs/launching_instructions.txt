1. Since this web app uses php to process data, it cannot be run with "Live Server" feature in VSCode.
So a local server has to be launched in order for this profile page to work.
To launch a server I used a command "php -S localhost:8000" and opened the site with the link "http://localhost:8000/docs/profile.php";

2. In order for this command to work, you need to have php installed;

3. For this part I am not sure: the program interacts with the database called "jobster",
but i don't think that this database is saved somewhere in the project's folder (I haven’t figured that out, unfortunately).
So I included a script file that would create a database needed for this app to work (docs\sql_scripts\jobster_db.sql).
(it doesn't create anything, it only has the code for creating)
